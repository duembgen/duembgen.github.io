We have conducted a group project over several years on vector geometry problems. We coined the term [Coordinate Difference Matrices](/publications/Baechler2020.html), mathematical objects closely related to *Euclidean Distance Matrices*, which exhibit some interesting mathematical properties. These properties can be exploited in various active research domains, such as the molecular conformation problem, multi-modal localization and microphone array calibration.
