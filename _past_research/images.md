Since my [Master's thesis](/assets/pdfs/FINALMasterThesisFD.pdf) at the Autonomous Systems Lab, I have been interested in computer vision, in particular in 3D reconstruction. I had the chance to work on this topic again during an internship at Disney Research in Los Angeles, which resulted in [this](/publications/ICIP2019.html) paper and a [U.S. patent](/publications/Mitchell2018.html). Besides that, I had three projects with my colleagues from [IVRL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ivrl/): a project on [image dehazing](/publciations/Duembgen2018.html), a tutorial paper on [Fourier deconvolution](/publications/ElHelou2018.html), and a project on a [novel activation loss for convolutional neural networks](/publications/ElHelou2020.html).
