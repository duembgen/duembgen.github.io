We have created a smartphone-compatible indoor localization solution based on Bluetooth signal strength, WiFi round-trip-time, inertial measurement unit signals, and occasional camera images. This project was a collaboration with the [School of Engineering and Architecture of Fribourg](www.heia-fr.ch) and [Vidinoti](www.vidinoti.com), a company providing Augmented Reality solutions. Our method, presented at [IPIN2019](/publications/Duembgen2019.html), does not require prior calibration or fingerprinting, while maintaining meter-level accuracy.
