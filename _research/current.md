I am currently working on localization solutions for the [Crazyflie](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyflie-2-1/) drone, a developer-friendly microdrone. In particular, we have built a custom UWB extension deck, that can be used in connection with our method for [non-synchronous distance measurements](/publications/Pacholska2020.html) for recovery of the drone's trajectories. We are also working on a microphone extension deck which will allow us to put angle-based algorithms (see for example [this](/publications/Duembgen2020.html) paper) into practice, and to try to emulate bat-like behaviour. Stay tuned!
