I am currently working on localization solutions for the [Crazyflie](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyflie-2-1/) drone, a developer-friendly nano drone. In particular, we have built a custom audio deck with microphones and a buzzer for bat-like wall detection. We have also built a custom UWB extension deck that can be used in connection with our method for [non-synchronous distance measurements](/publications/Pacholska2020.html) for recovery of the drone's trajectories.
