We have investigated ways to use audio signals for localization and mapping on small robots, getting rid of the commonly placed requirement for high-quality measurement microphones and powerful speakers, and replacing it with more commonly available MEMS microphones and little alarm-like buzzers. Our research shows that walls can be reliably detected and avoided, based on sound only, on small robots such as the [Crazyflie](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyflie-2-1/) drone, a developer-friendly nano drone, and the [e-puck2](https://e-puck.gctronic.com/) education robot. For this purpose, we have built a custom extension deck with microphones and a buzzer for the Crazyflie drone, thus emulating a "bat drone". More details are available in our [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9844245) (also available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04266)), published in RA-L 2022 and presented at IROS 2022 in Kyoto, and in our [blogpost](https://www.bitcraze.io/2023/01/from-crazyflies-to-crazybats/) on the Crazyflie website.
