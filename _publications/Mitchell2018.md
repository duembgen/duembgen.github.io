title: Dense Reconstruction for Narrow Baseline Motion Observations
---


Techniques for constructing a three-dimensional model of facial geometry are disclosed. A first three-dimensional model of an object is generated, based on a plurality of captured images of the object. A projected three-dimensional model of the object is determined, based on a plurality of identified blendshapes relating to the object. A second three- dimensional model of the object is generated, based on the first three-dimensional model of the object and the projected three dimensional model of the object.
