<p>We have created a smartphone-compatible indoor localization solution based on Bluetooth signal strength, WiFi round-trip-time, inertial measurement unit signals, and occasional camera images. This project was a collaboration with the <a href="www.heia-fr.ch">School of Engineering and Architecture of Fribourg</a> and <a href="www.vidinoti.com">Vidinoti</a>, a company providing Augmented Reality solutions. Our method, presented at <a href="/publications/Duembgen2019.html">IPIN2019</a>, does not require prior calibration or fingerprinting, while maintaining meter-level accuracy.</p>
