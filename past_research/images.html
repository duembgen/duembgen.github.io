<p>Since my <a href="/assets/pdfs/FINALMasterThesisFD.pdf">Masterâ€™s thesis</a> at the Autonomous Systems Lab, I have been interested in computer vision, in particular in 3D reconstruction. I had the chance to work on this topic again during an internship at Disney Research in Los Angeles, which resulted in <a href="/publications/ICIP2019.html">this</a> paper and a <a href="/publications/Mitchell2018.html">U.S. patent</a>. Besides that, I had three projects with my colleagues from <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ivrl/">IVRL</a>: a project on <a href="/publciations/Duembgen2018.html">image dehazing</a>, a tutorial paper on <a href="/publications/ElHelou2018.html">Fourier deconvolution</a>, and a project on a <a href="/publications/ElHelou2020.html">novel activation loss for convolutional neural networks</a>.</p>
