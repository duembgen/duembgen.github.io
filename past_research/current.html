<p>We have investigated ways to use audio signals for localization and mapping on small robots, getting rid of the commonly placed requirement for high-quality measurement microphones and powerful speakers, and replacing it with more commonly available MEMS microphones and little alarm-like buzzers. Our research shows that walls can be reliably detected and avoided, based on sound only, on small robots such as the <a href="https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyflie-2-1/">Crazyflie</a> drone, a developer-friendly nano drone, and the <a href="https://e-puck.gctronic.com/">e-puck2</a> education robot. For this purpose, we have built a custom extension deck with microphones and a buzzer for the Crazyflie drone, thus emulating a “bat drone”. More details are available in our <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9844245">paper</a> (also available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04266">arXiv</a>), published in RA-L 2022 and presented at IROS 2022 in Kyoto, and in our <a href="https://www.bitcraze.io/2023/01/from-crazyflies-to-crazybats/">blogpost</a> on the Crazyflie website.</p>
