<p>We have conducted a group project over several years on vector geometry problems. We coined the term <a href="/publications/Baechler2020.html">Coordinate Difference Matrices</a>, mathematical objects closely related to <em>Euclidean Distance Matrices</em>, which exhibit some interesting mathematical properties. These properties can be exploited in various active research domains, such as the molecular conformation problem, multi-modal localization and microphone array calibration.</p>
