Frederike Dümbgen is currently a Postdoc at the University of Toronto, working with Prof. Tim Barfoot in the Autonomous Space Systems Lab, Robotics Institute. She received her PhD with thesis entitled "Blind as a bat: spatial perception without sight" in November 2021, with advisors Prof. Martin Vetterli and Dr. Adam Scholefield in the department of computer science at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland. Before that, she obtained her B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering at EPFL in 2013 and 2016, respectively, with a minor in Compuational Science and Engineering. Her research has spanned from novel localization methods, in particular acoustic, radio-frequency-based and ultra-wideband localization, to, most recently, globally optimal methods for robotics.
