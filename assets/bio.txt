Frederike Dümbgen is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Robotics Institute of University of Toronto, working with Prof. Tim Barfoot in the Autonomous Space Robotics Lab. She received her PhD with thesis entitled "Blind as a bat: spatial perception without sight" in November 2021, under the advisors Prof. Martin Vetterli and Dr. Adam Scholefield from the Laboratory of AudioVisual Communications (LCAV) in Computer Science at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland. Before that, she obtained her B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from EPFL in 2013 and 2016, respectively, with a minor in Computational Science and Engineering, and Master's thesis at the Autonomous Systems Lab of ETH Zürich.
Her research has ranged from novel localization methods, in particular acoustic, radio-frequency and ultra-wideband localization, to, most recently, globally optimal methods for robotics.
