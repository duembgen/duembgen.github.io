I am a 5th year PhD student in the Laboratory of Audiovisual Communications ([**LCAV**](https://lcav.epfl.ch)) at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (**EPFL**).

I hold a Master's degree of Mechnical Engineering with specialization in control and mechatronics from EPFL. I had the opportunity to conduct my Master's Thesis at the Autonomous Systems Lab ([**ASL**](https://asl.ethz.ch)) at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (**ETHZ**). I also visited the University of **Heriot Watt** in Edinburgh during the third year of my Bachelor studies.  

In terms of work experience, I had the chance to conduct internships at Disney Research in Los Angeles, ABB Switzerland and Bystronic Laser AG, Switzerland. 

For the past few years, I have also been a proud supporter of a few great initiatives in Switzerland, such as the [**voCHabular**](https://vochabular.ch) project, teaching Swiss German for free via a book and app. During the same time, I helped [**GirlsCoding**](https://girlscoding.org) with several workshops and public relations. I also gave a workshop on *python* coding to the students from the [**PowerCoders**](https://powercoders.ch) programm in Berne and I co-supervised the internship project by one student. I am always looking for opportunities to put my knowledge to use for society, please get in touch if you have any ideas or questions! 

I am grateful for receiving the *Women Techmaker Scholarship* from Google in 2020, the *EDIC* fellowship for the first year of my PhD in 2016, and the *NCCR Robotics Scholarship for Women* for my Master's Thesis.
