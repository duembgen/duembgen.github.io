I am currently a Postdoc at the University of Toronto, working with Prof. Tim Barfoot, which I started in March 2022. Before that, I obtained my PhD from the Laboratory of Audiovisual Communications ([**LCAV**](https://lcav.epfl.ch)) at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (**EPFL**), under the supervision of Martin Vetterli and Adam Scholefield.

I hold a Master's degree of Mechnical Engineering with specialization in control and mechatronics from EPFL. I had the opportunity to conduct my Master's Thesis at the Autonomous Systems Lab ([**ASL**](https://asl.ethz.ch)) at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (**ETHZ**), and I performed the third year of my Bachelor studies at the University of **Heriot Watt** in Edinburgh.  

In terms of work experience, I had the chance to conduct internships at Disney Research in Los Angeles, ABB Switzerland and Bystronic Laser AG, Switzerland. 

For the past few years, I have also been a proud supporter of a few great initiatives in Switzerland. I led the app development team of the [**voCHabular**](https://vochabular.ch) project, teaching Swiss German for free via a book and app. I helped [**GirlsCoding**](https://girlscoding.org) with several workshops and public relations. I also gave a workshop on *python* coding to the students from the [**PowerCoders**](https://powercoders.ch) programm in Berne and I co-supervised the internship project by one student. I am always looking for opportunities to put my knowledge to use for society, please get in touch if you have any ideas or questions! 

I am grateful for receiving the *Postdoc.Mobility* grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation in 2021, the *Women Techmaker Scholarship* from Google in 2020, the *EDIC* fellowship from EPFL for the first year of my PhD in 2016, and the *NCCR Robotics Scholarship for Women* for my Master's Thesis.
