I am interested in the localization of connected devices such as smartphones, drones, and other mobile robots. I consider environments known to various degrees (e.g. known anchors) or completely unknown (SLAM framework) and I work with signals including Bluetooth, WiFi, Ultra-Wideband (UWB), camera images and sound. In particular, I investigate how theory from distance geometry can be extended to include more diverse measurements; how to cope with uncertainty, and how to deal with non-synchronized measurements.

More generally, I am interested in exploiting mathematics and signal processing to improve spatial perception on mobile devices.
