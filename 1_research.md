My research vision is to equip robots with certifiably optimal and safe behavior, enabling their seamless integration into complex and dynamic environments shared with humans. 

My research focus to date has been on the aspect of safe spatial perception, which I believe is the fundamental enabler for all complex tasks that robots need to solve. An important aspect of safety in spatial perception is  being able to certify the quality of solutions to non-convex optimization problems, which we have addressed in our latest stream work works on global optimality for state estimation. Another important aspect is safe operation in the event of sensor degradation, to which I have contributed during my PhD using unconventional, non-visual measurement modalities for spatial perception, such as Bluetooth, WiFi, Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and sound, thus increasing the resilience of robots to the failure of one or more sensing modalities. 

More broadly speaking, I am interested in applied mathematics and formal guarantees for robotics, and the interplay between model-based and data-driven approaches for safe autonomy.
