My research vision is to make robots efficient and safe, enabling their seamless integration into complex and dynamic environments shared with humans.

One important aspect of safety in spatial perception is being able to certify the quality of solutions to non-convex optimization problems, which we have addressed in our latest stream work works on global optimality for state estimation. Another important aspect is safe operation in the event of sensor degradation, to which I have contributed during my PhD using unconventional, non-visual measurement modalities, such as Bluetooth, WiFi, Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and sound, thus increasing the resilience of robots to the failure of one or more sensing modalities. 

When it comes to efficiency, I explore methods to exploit advanced concepts from optimization to improve the solution quality of policy learning and to improve sample efficiency. 

More broadly speaking, I am interested in the intersections of applied mathematics, artificial intelligence, and robotics, to enable provably safe, sample-efficient, and generalizable autonomy.
