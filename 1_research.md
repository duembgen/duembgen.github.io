I am interested in the localization of connected devices such as smartphones, drones, and other mobile robots. I consider environments known to various degrees or completely unknown (SLAM framework) and I work with various signals such as Bluetooth, WiFi, Ultra-Wideband (UWB), camera images and sound. In particular, I investigate how theory from distance geometry can be extended to include more diverse measurements; how to cope with uncertainty, and how to deal with non-synchronized measurements.

In a broader sense, I am interested in applying the mathematical principles discovered in localization to data analysis and visualization.
