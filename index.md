I am a researcher in robotics, interested in making autonomous robots more robust and trustworthy. I am currently a starting researcher in the WILLOW research group at Inria Paris. Until February 2024, I was a postdoc at the University of Toronto in the Robotics Institute, working with Timothy D. Barfoot on certifiably optimal state estimation. Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. in the AudioVisual Communications Laboratory (LCAV) at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) under the supervision of Martin Vetterli and Adam Scholefield, working on non-visual spatial perception.

## News 

*Last update: June 5, 2024.*

**June 2024** We have created a [Summary paper](assets/pdfs/summary_paper_2024.pdf) of our latest research on certifiably optimal estimation. It is intended as an entry point for anyone who wants to learn about this topic and for an overview of our recent advances in the area.   

**May 2024** Very grateful to be in this year's cohort of [RSS Pioneers](https://sites.google.com/view/rsspioneers2024/)!

**May 2024** I am delighted to be starting my new appointment as Starting Researcher in the WILLOW research group at Inria Paris, where I will be working with Justin Carpentier, Stéphane Caron and an amazing team of robotics/optimization researchers and engineers. 

**March 2024 - April 2024** I had the opportunity to visit the lab of Nicolas Boumal, EPFL, and Sylvain Calinon, IDIAP, Switzerland, giving talks about our work at both institutes, and getting to know a lot of cool new research! Thank you for hosting me!

**March 2024** Our full-day workshop on [Frontiers of optimization for robotics](https://sites.google.com/robotics.utias.utoronto.ca/frontiers-optimization-rss24/home) was accepted for RSS 2024. Looking forward to a great lineup of speakers and a day full of interesting discussions!

**November 2023** What a pleasure to be presenting our latest research at MIT, Harvard and Northeastern University in Boston! The recording from my talk at MIT is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzTp3jQrM00) and the slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQ4JcmF12qCUjJacpTgdrZHj0emQiGN5_Jrm4EM0XxrZpBtGZoGbMXXC65zGf7AUJdIH-AV4W1ZvheF/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=30000). Thank you to everyone for hosting me! 

**September 2023** More pre-prints of our brilliant students now available! Zi Cong (Daniel) Guo's work on Koopman SLAM is available [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.04375.pdf) and Abhishek Goudar's work on certifiable range-only pose estimation is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09011). 

**August 2023** So grateful to speak at [this](https://lcav25.info/) wonderful 2-day anniversary celebration of "Signal Processing and Friends" organized by my former lab, LCAV, EPFL Switzerland. Also, presented our latest research at Aude Billard's LASA lab at EPFL. Slides available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vStOD9jTtpyO-FV8Gf56D5Iip0aFabYmzaETrmQKatf1HQFNIA5SoquGsN30NWCsr_rVNrfVGcx_n5_/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).

**August 2023** Two new pre-prints of our latest work are now available on arXiv. Our work on automatically tightening semidefintie relaxations can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05783) and Connor Holmes work on tightness of matrix-weighted SLAM relaxations can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07275).


**March 2023** I gave a talk about our latest research in the Toronto AI in Robotics (AIR) Seminar. The recording is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA8pCuMY_2E&t=2523s). Thank you for having me! 

**February 2023** Our research on echolocation on drones and wheeled robots was featured in the [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2357770-flying-robot-echolocates-like-a-bat-to-avoid-banging-into-walls/), [TechXplore](https://techxplore.com/news/2023-02-bat-inspired-framework-equip-robots-sound-based.html), [netzwoche](https://www.netzwoche.ch/news/2023-02-19/diese-drohne-orientiert-sich-nur-ueber-das-echo), [popsci](https://www.popsci.com/technology/robot-echolocation-bat/) and [engadget](https://www.engadget.com/echolocation-small-robots-search-and-rescue-103953284.html). Great to see this much interest in bat-like robots!   

**January 2023** Thank you to the *bitcraze* team for inviting me to write a [blogpost](https://www.bitcraze.io/2023/01/from-crazyflies-to-crazybats) about the Crazybat project!  

**December 2022** Our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3233232) (also available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04266)) on certified range-only localization was accepted to RA-L! Happy to present it at the upcoming IROS conference in Detroit in October 2023. 

**October 2022**: I will be presenting our RA-L [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9844245) on audible echolocation on small robots (aka the Crazybat project) at IROS 2022 in Kyoto.

**August 2022**: We submitted our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04266) on certified range-only continuous-time localization to RA-L.

**June 2022**: We published a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.05082.pdf) on certified robust line fitting, a good way to learn about certifiable algorithms on a deceivingly simple problem!
