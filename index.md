I am a researcher at the intersection of signal processing and robotics. I obtained my PhD in the Laboratory of Audiovisual Communications (LCAV) at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) under the supervision of Martin Vetterli and Adam Scholefield. I am excited to be starting a Postdoc at the University of Toronto in the Autonomous Space Robotics Lab (ASRL) led by Tim Barfoot, where I will be continuing my work to develop novel localization systems for a variety of mobile devices.
