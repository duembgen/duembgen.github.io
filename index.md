I am a 4th-year PhD student in the Laboratory of Audiovisual Communications (LCAV) at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). 

I am interested in the localization of connected devices such as smartphones, drones, and other mobile robots. In a broader sense, I am interested in robotics, signal processing, and in applying the mathematical principles discovered in localization to data analysis, and machine learning.
