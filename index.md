I am a 4th-year PhD student in the Laboratory of Audiovisual Communications (LCAV) at Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). 

My work is focused on the localization of connected devices such as smartphones, drones, or other mobile robots. I consider environments known to various degrees or completely unknown. To this end, I am employing Bluetooth, WiFi and Ultra-Wideband signals, but also camera images and sound signals. In particular, I investigate how to apply and extent existing theory from distance geometry to include more diverse measurement modalities and to cope with uncertainty. In a broader sense, I am intersted in applying the mathematical principles I use in localization to data analysis and visualization.
