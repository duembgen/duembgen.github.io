I am a researcher in robotics, working on bringing more formal guarantees to robotics algorithms. I am currently a Postdoc at the University of Toronto in the Robotics Institute working with Timothy D. Barfoot, on certifiable perception algorithms, or in other words, how to make sure a robot has a viable estimate of its location and/or surroundings. Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. in the Laboratory of Audiovisual Communications (LCAV) at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) under the supervision of Martin Vetterli and Adam Scholefield, working on non-visual spatial perception.

## News 

*Last update: October 21, 2023.*

**September 2023** More pre-prints of our brilliant students now available! Zi Cong (Daniel) Guo's work on Koopman SLAM is now available [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.04375.pdf) and Abhishek Goudar's work on certifiable range-only pose estimation is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09011). 

**August 2023** So grateful to speak at [this](https://lcav25.info/) wonderful 2-day anniversary celebration of "Signal Processing and Friends" organized by my former lab, LCAV, EPFL Switzerland. Also, presented our latest research at Aude Billard's LASA lab at EPFL. Slides available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vStOD9jTtpyO-FV8Gf56D5Iip0aFabYmzaETrmQKatf1HQFNIA5SoquGsN30NWCsr_rVNrfVGcx_n5_/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).

**August 2023** Two new pre-prints of our latest work are now available on arXiv. Our work on automatically tightening semidefintie relaxations can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05783) and Connor Holmes work on tightness of matrix-weighted SLAM relaxations can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07275).


**March 2023** I gave a talk about our latest research in the Toronto AI in Robotics (AIR) Seminar. The recording is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA8pCuMY_2E&t=2523s).

**February 2023** Our research on echolocation on drones and wheeled robots was featured in the [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2357770-flying-robot-echolocates-like-a-bat-to-avoid-banging-into-walls/), [TechXplore](https://techxplore.com/news/2023-02-bat-inspired-framework-equip-robots-sound-based.html), [netzwoche](https://www.netzwoche.ch/news/2023-02-19/diese-drohne-orientiert-sich-nur-ueber-das-echo), [popsci](https://www.popsci.com/technology/robot-echolocation-bat/) and [engadget](https://www.engadget.com/echolocation-small-robots-search-and-rescue-103953284.html). Great to see this much interest in bat-like robots!   

**January 2023** Thank you to the *bitcraze* team for inviting me to write a [blogpost](https://www.bitcraze.io/2023/01/from-crazyflies-to-crazybats) about the Crazybat project!  

**December 2022** Our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3233232) (also available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04266)) on certified range-only localization was accepted to RA-L! Happy to present it at the upcoming IROS conference in Detroit in October 2023. 

**October 2022**: I will be presenting our RA-L [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9844245) on audible echolocation on small robots (aka the Crazybat project) at IROS 2022 in Kyoto.

**August 2022**: We submitted our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04266) on certified range-only continuous-time localization to RA-L.

**June 2022**: We published a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.05082.pdf) on certified robust line fitting, a good way to learn about certifiable algorithms on a deceivingly simple problem! 

**December 2021**: I received the [Postdoc.Mobility](https://www.snf.ch/en/XIZpfY3iVS5KRRoD/funding/careers/postdoc-mobility) grant for a 2-year postdoc with Tim Barfoot at UofT, starting in March 2022.

**November 2021**: I successfully defended my [PhD thesis](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/290057?ln=en).

**May 2020**: We presented our [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9053903) at ICASSP 2020. 

**May 2020**: I received the Google Women Techmakers Scholarship in Computer Science.

**May 2020**: We presented our [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8978573) at ICRA 2020.  

**April 2020**: I joined EPFL's first [online hackathon](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/hackathon-generates-over-100-ideas-to-combat-covid/) as a mentor for students working on projects to help combat Covid19.
