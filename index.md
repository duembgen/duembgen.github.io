I am a researcher at the intersection of signal processing and robotics. I obtained my PhD in the Laboratory of Audiovisual Communications (LCAV) at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) under the supervision of Martin Vetterli and Adam Scholefield. Next, I will be doing a 2-year Postdoc at the University of Toronto in the Autonomous Space Robotics Lab (ASRL) of Tim Barfoot, where I will continue my work on developing novel localization systems for a variety of mobile devices.
