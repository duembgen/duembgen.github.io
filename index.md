I am a researcher in robotics, with a focus on optimization and signal processing. I am currently a Postdoc at the University of Toronto in the Autonomous Space Robotics Lab (ASRL) of Tim Barfoot, where I work on certifiable perception algorithms, or in other words, how to make sure a robot has a viable representation of its location and/or surroundings. I obtained my PhD in the Laboratory of Audiovisual Communications (LCAV) at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) under the supervision of Martin Vetterli and Adam Scholefield.

*Last update: January 18, 2023.*

**January 2023** Thank you to the *bitcraze* team for inviting me to write a [blogpost](https://www.bitcraze.io/2023/01/from-crazyflies-to-crazybats) about the Crazybat project!  

**December 2022** Our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3233232) (also available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04266)) on certified range-only localization was accepted to RA-L! Happy to present it at the upcoming IROS conference in Detroit. 

**October 2022**: I will be presenting our RA-L [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9844245) on audible echolocation on small robots (aka the Crazybat project) at IROS 2022 in Kyoto.

**August 2022**: We submitted our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04266) on certified range-only continuous-time localization to RA-L.

**June 2022**: We published a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.05082.pdf) on certified robust line fitting, a good way to learn about certifiable algorithms on a deceivingly simple problem! 

**December 2021**: I received the [Postdoc.Mobility](https://www.snf.ch/en/XIZpfY3iVS5KRRoD/funding/careers/postdoc-mobility) grant for a 2-year postdoc with Tim Barfoot at UofT, starting in March 2022.

**November 2021**: I successfully defended my [PhD thesis](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/290057?ln=en).

**May 2020**: We presented our [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9053903) at ICASSP 2020. 

**May 2020**: I received the Google Women Techmakers Scholarship in Computer Science.

**May 2020**: We presented our [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8978573) at ICRA 2020.  

**April 2020**: I joined EPFL's first [online hackathon](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/hackathon-generates-over-100-ideas-to-combat-covid/) as a mentor for students working on projects to help combat Covid19.
