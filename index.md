I am a 4th-year PhD student in the Laboratory of Audiovisual Communications (LCAV) at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). 

In the context of my PhD thesis, I am interested in the localization of connected devices such as smartphones, drones, and other mobile robots. I consider environments known to various degrees or completely unknown (the SLAM framework) and I leverage Bluetooth, WiFi and Ultra-Wideband signals, camera images and sound. In particular, I investigate how theory from distance geometry can be extended to include more diverse measurements, to cope with uncertainty, and to use non-synchronized measurements.

In a broader sense, I am interested in applying the mathematical principles discovered in localization to data analysis and visualization.
