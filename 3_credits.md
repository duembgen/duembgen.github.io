I created this website using [github-pages](https://pages.github.com). It is powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), a static website generator.

Thanks to [this](http://veithen.github.io/2015/03/26/jekyll-bootstrap.html) blog post, integrating bootstrap css into this website was straight-forward. Note that instead of creating a new "styles/site.scss" file as described in step 3., it was enough to change the "assets/main.scss" file,
which comes with the default "minima" template.

I also followed [this](https://michaelsoolee.com/google-analytics-jekyll/) guide to deploy Google Analytics.
